                        </div>
                        <p>Psychotherapy or counseling may be helpful for individuals suffering from an array of emotional difficulties. Individuals suffering from depression, anxiety, relationship problems, eating disorders, panic attacks, phobias, or addictions may benefit from the many treatment approaches that psychologists, social workers, religious leaders, and counselors offer. In addition, therapy can be of great benefit in dealing with stressful events and major life transitions. These may include, for example, job or relationship loss, parenting issues, stress-related illness and physical symptoms, or death and grief. Therapy can often help people adjust more quickly and effectively to adverse events.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In general, when emotional issues begin to interfere with individual, family, work, or social functioning, therapy is indicated. In addition, treatment is clearly indicated for those who are experiencing recurrent thoughts of harming themselves or others, and/or become unable to care for their basic needs. Individuals who need therapy are often caught in a vicious cycle in which their efforts to bring about personal change on their own are increasingly ineffective. In spite of their many attempts to change, people often find that they lack the tools to make changes. In essence, they need the objective perspective of a trained professional. While there are many different treatment approaches, most therapies provide an opportunity to identify ineffective coping patterns and assistance in learning new, more effective methods of responding in a safe, accepting, and supportive environment. Ultimately, a more objective perspective of oneself is gained, and important decisions in life are made more consciously. In short, therapy can help you find the answers.</p>
