                            <h1>When Panic<em> Attacks</em></h1>
                        </div>
                     <p>There are some individuals who experience very intense, physiological symptoms that will occur repeatedly and quite unexpectedly in the absence of any apparent, external trigger. These are referred to as panic attacks, and they are thought to occur when the body's normal stress circuitry becomes inappropriately aroused. Some or all of the following symptoms may accompany these episodes.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p>There may be an impending fear of dying, a concern about totally losing physical or emotional control, going crazy, or doing something embarrassing. Some people lose their sense of reality, experience flushes or chills, and/or tingling or numbness in the hands. Other individuals experience difficulty breathing, dizziness, chest pains, as well as a racing or pounding heartbeat.</p>
                     <br>
                     <p>Perhaps the best way to describe these attacks is with the word 'terror.' There is a sense that something unimaginably horrible is about to occur and that they have no power to prevent it.</p>
                     <br>
                      <div class="text-content">
                     <div class="section-heading"> 
                      <ul>
                        <li>So severe are these attacks that, in many individuals, it is the anxiety associated with the possibility of having another panic attack that, in turn, serves as a trigger for emotional upheaval. The initial panic attack may often be associated with some form of stress. It may result from being overworked, or it may be secondary to the loss of a close family member or friend. Some people experience the attacks following the stress associated with surgery, a serious accident, illness, or even childbirth. Certain drugs also can stimulate panic attacks, for example, excessive consumption of caffeine or the use of cocaine can sometimes trigger these types of reactions. Despite the association with stress, these attacks usually take people totally by surprise, and it is their unpredictable nature that results in their being so disruptive. Obviously, a preoccupation with such disruptive events will stifle any motivation to proceed toward a goal. Here are several strategies for coping with panic, and these will be worthwhile, whether the panic attacks occur intermittently or on a regular basis. You will notice that the strategies are simply modifications of the techniques that already have been described in the context of lesser reactions to stress.<br><br>
                          <ol>
                            <li>It is important to remember that, although they may seem to be overwhelming, your feelings are not, by themselves, dangerous or harmful.</li>
                            <li>Know that if you are experiencing a panic attack, you are experiencing the very same physiological changes that evolved to enable you to survive an emergency. You are simply experiencing an exaggeration of your normal response to stress.</li>
                            <li>Don't try to force the feelings away. The more you are willing to recognize the feelings and face them head-on, the less intense they will become.</li>
                            <li>Avoid exacerbating your attack by dwelling on what might happen now or in the future.</li>
                            <li>Maintain a constant flow of calming and affirming self-talk. Remind yourself that you are in no real, physical danger; that youâ€™ve gotten through this before, and you will survive it again; that the physical symptoms will pass, and it is safe to relax.</li>
                            <li>Breathe, slowly and deeply, from your diaphragm. This promotes the relaxation response in the body, as well as serves as evidence that you are, indeed, able to breathe just fine.</li>

                            <li>Distract yourself. Shifting your attention to a repetitive task may divert your attention and your anxiety.</li>
                          </ol>
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                     </div>
                     </div>  
                     <br>  
                     <p>By utilizing these strategies, you will notice that when you stop engaging in behaviors that add to your fear, the anxiety itself will begin to fade away. You also will become instantly aware that these strategies do work, and this will make you feel good about the fact that you have succeeded. Once you acquire this understanding, you will be ready to successfully achieve your goals.</p>
