                    <h1>Overcoming<em> Fear</em></h1>
                </div>
                <p>It’s now time to learn some skills to help you better handle negative emotions. Many people cling to outmoded beliefs because they enable them to avoid an emotion that causes pain or discomfort. For example, Complaining gets you nowhere. Let’s imagine that this belief has its roots in early childhood when a complaint triggered a belligerent reaction on the part of a parent. (For example, Dad believed children should be seen and not heard.) Yes, in that environment and at that time, the child’s belief was justified. It kept the kid out of trouble in the home. The fear response elicited by the parent’s angry outburst had definite survival value. But, things have changed. In the retail store, it’s not healthy to internalize anger because you still believe it’s wrong to complain about having been overcharged. As well is to simply fume over the overcooked steak at the restaurant and say nothing to the waiter. All you’ve done is replace the fear associated with speaking out with the anger of feeling wronged. Simply registering a complaint could so easily have dissipated that anger. I’ll bet that if you really were to think about it, there are many things that you regret not having done out of fear. Even within the past 24 hours, you may well have stretched turn the other cheek beyond its intended boundary. Why? Probably because you wanted to avoid the fear that might have been precipitated had the other person responded like Dad did so many decades ago.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The first question to ask is, “Is this belief that it’s wrong to complain justified?” The answer is No. There’s nothing noble about being wronged and saying nothing. When you have been overcharged for a purchase, the belief that it is wrong to speak up is not justified.</p>
                <br>
                <p>“Is the belief serving a useful purpose?” Of course not. It’s serving a harmful purpose. Doing nothing is one of the behaviors normally associated with a feeling of helplessness, a feeling that will erode your health faster than anything else.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Let’s approach change by starting with the end. After all, it would require a great deal of time and the skills of a gifted therapist to travel back in time and revisit your early childhood to identify the cause of the belief. Instead, let’s start at the end with the fear that you are trying to avoid. When you cast aside all the details, what you are left with is a belief that enables you to avoid the emotion of fear. That’s what you can fix.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At my Saddlebrook Resort headquarters near Tampa, Florida, I have created a program that’s designed to deal with what is probably the greatest impediment to personal growth and corporate success: the fear of failure. I focus upon the issue of fear to start with and take people out of their comfort zone, away from all the things that provide security. They are taken into the woods where there are no walls displaying certificates of achievement; where there’s no place for the coat and tie they rely upon to convey power and authority in the workplace; where the expensive gold watch or reserve of cash are of no value. That alone enables some people to push their personal comfort envelope and learn to deal with the mild fear of being in a novel environment. Of course, everyone is having fun during the process. They are playing games and enjoying themselves. There’s no reason why learning a valuable lesson cannot also be fun. And, sometimes, this serves as a useful diversion, or what I refer to as emotional interference. The friendly exchanges, as people enter this unfamiliar territory, serve to counterbalance their uncertainty.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In this new environment, the old, familiar beliefs are easier to let go of as a new group with a different purpose and different dynamics begins to form, a group that now requires different skills to function effectively. This is the first critical step to change - getting rid of old, unhealthy beliefs. In this new environment, the ability to predict has vanished, giving rise to uncertainty. Our course includes ropes suspended from trees, wire bridges, a zip line, countless problem- solving initiatives, and a rock-climbing wall. Some people greet this new environment and the uncertainty it brings with excitement and even elation. Others clearly are uncomfortable being away from their normal routine. In his own way, each person is dealing with change on his own terms. I have created an environment where they can learn to overcome fear safely. The stock-boy with rock-climbing experience overcomes his nervousness of speaking to the owner of the company when it becomes clear to the group that his skills now are going to be a tremendous asset. And the CEO learns to deal with the discomfort of being in a subservient position and having little to offer in this new setting. No one is ever pressured into crossing out of his comfort zone. But, if they want to explore, one small step at a time, what it’s like to experience a fear response and then recovery from it, they can do it safely, in a wonderfully supportive environment. That evening, they hear an after-dinner talk, using film clips of the day’s activities, during which I discuss many of the issues I’m now delving into.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When it’s over, people are better equipped to deal with the fears of change. They have learned to accept change and to cope with uncertainty on their terms so that when they experience similar challenges in the workplace or in their personal lives, they can do what my family does after an adventure vacation. The body can shrug off any new challenge by saying, “Been there, done that, and got the tee-shirt, no problem.” Bring on the next challenge. It’s Cross-Stressing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It’s just like a child acquiring a new language. Learning a foreign language is very difficult. But, once it’s acquired, it becomes relatively easy to acquire another new language because the child now has a learning set for languages. What you can do is acquire a learning set for change. The ability to face the emotional consequences of change head-on will enable you to accept the risks you have to take to establish new boundaries in your professional and personal life.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you cannot accept change, you will always remain where you are now in a world that is in a constant state of flux. This concept applies not just to the business world, but to your relationships, as well. A healthy business organization is a living system, constantly in the process of growing. Individuals who have the capacity to deal with change drive healthy companies. Healthy people also recognize that during the course of a relationship, they and their partner change. Healthy people are willing to constantly examine their beliefs as they prepare for inevitable change in both their personal and professional lives. But you cannot learn to change without accepting some potential risk, if nothing else, the prospect of failure. The training itself can be risky as you face your beliefs head-on and set about to create new mental images to better match your ever-changing circumstances.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Here’s an exercise that I call Pushing Your Emotional Envelope.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Beginning today, I want you to practice dealing with change and the emotion of fear. For the next week, do one thing each day that is a departure from your normal way of behaving. It doesn’t matter what it is. The only objective is to familiarize yourself with the feeling. And I’m not suggesting that you take up a dangerous sport or throw yourself in harm’s way. There are many things that you can do that are quite safe from a physical standpoint, but which provide the opportunity to grow emotionally. Do you have a fear of public speaking? Then attend a PTA or city council meeting and make it a point to stand up and comment about an issue. Do the same at your next company training session. Ultimately, you might volunteer to make a presentation at a fundraiser or join a church choir. Is winning your objective? Even on the highway, where you always want to be in front of the car ahead? Or, first off the line at the traffic light? Then ease off on the accelerator, and be a follower. Let another motorist move ahead of you so that you can experience the emotion you have been trying to avoid. Are you always in control and the expert in your organization? Then become a volunteer. Spend some time at a homeless shelter, serving food or sweeping floors. Offer to help do something, knowing in advance that you have limited skills in this arena. Step out of your comfort zone, and learn to accept advice and instruction from others.</p>

               <br>
               <p>I once enrolled in a 5- day training program on how to run a ropes course. It was a new experience for me. For years, I’d been the person in front of the classroom, presenting the training and being asked the questions. Suddenly, I found myself immersed in a group of people half my age and with largely physical education backgrounds, instead of science. No one had any need for my information, and I had few answers to the questions being posed. Instead, I was doing the asking, while seeking the skills I eventually would need. I was a stranger in this environment. Even the frost during that fall in Massachusetts was a departure from the warmth I had grown accustomed to at my home in Florida. But, the experience gave me new insights about other aspects of my life. Just experiencing the feeling associated with that unfamiliar role provided me with a different way of looking at things.</p>
               <br>
               <p>There’s another way you can teach yourself to better handle negative emotions – experience them on your terms and discover that they really aren’t all that bad. When I conduct multi-day training programs, I will give participants an assignment to find a partner and do something that’s legal and reasonably safe, but which takes them outside their emotional comfort zone. The reason I have them pair up is because there’s safety in numbers, plus the other person provides the extra motivation that is sometimes needed.</p>

                <br> 
                <p>Some of these things may be a part of your normal routine. However, for some individuals, these activities may offer an opportunity to experience what emotional discomfort can be like. More importantly, they got over it. That’s the key element. Successfully recovering from adversity is how we learn to be optimistic. “This, too, shall pass” is the lesson learned. And if it’s really bad, from that point on, you can reflect upon the experience, and when confronted with a different type of challenge, say to yourself, “I’m glad I’m not ______ (in cold water, bungee jumping, or whatever you did that raised your adrenalin).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Use successive approximation. Take small steps until you feel comfortable leaving your familiar surroundings and operating with a new set of beliefs. Examine each emotion that you experience along with your beliefs. By immersing yourself in novel environments, you’ll develop the ability to accept and trust others, and to gain the confidence to accept change. Armed with those skills, there is no limit to what you will achieve.</p>
                <br>
                <p>You may totally agree with this advice, but still be reluctant. I don’t have time or It won’t improve the appearance of my resume may be the belief holding you back. I once was faced with that same dilemma.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’d been offered a very good job at the University of Texas Medical School in Galveston. It was a tenure-track position, which, even in those days, was difficult to secure. At the same time, I also was offered a position with the National Geographic Society to lead an expedition to study whales in the West Indies. I did all of the things you’re supposed to do: I sought input from trusted academic advisors. One said, “Nick, if you go down to the West Indies, you will be committing academic suicide. You’ll never keep up; you’ll forget everything you learned. Don’t throw away your education.” And other people said the same thing. That’s when I created two lists; one included all of the reasons why I should have accepted the job at the medical school in Texas, and I filled up a legal pad. And then I made a list of all of the reasons why I should go to the West Indies, and I could have fitted them onto a postage stamp.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But, I really wanted to go to the islands, so I re-framed the question. Instead of asking myself, “What should I do?” I asked, “What will I regret not having done at some future date?” And within weeks, my wife and I packed up our then six-month-old daughter and sailed off into the sunset. To this day, I have never had a real job, and, at this stage in my life, I probably never will. Did I make the right decision? I don’t know. There’s no way of ever knowing, so I don’t even bother to ponder the matter. Do I have any regrets? Absolutely not. I’ve accumulated a treasure chest of experiences and, in the process, learned to adapt to just about every category of change. So, while you are thinking of reasons not to do the things you can and should, take a moment to step out of the present, and peer into the future. That new perspective may be just the vantage point that you need to make the right choice.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There’s one more thing. You are converting one of the most powerful emotions you ever experience into a catalyst for change. Fear of regret is now replacing fear of failure. Instead of a fear holding you back, you now have converted it into a force to propel you forward.</p>
