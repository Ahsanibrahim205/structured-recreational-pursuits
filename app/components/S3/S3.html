                            <li>Someone at work who is high-paced & goal-driven may obtain tremendous
wellness benefits by having at least one contrasting recreational pursuit which is
<ol>
    <li>slower paced, maybe both mentally and physically</li>
    <li>has few ‘highly important’ success, achievement or ego-driven goals to focus on, at least in the way he/she takes part in this leisure activity</li>
</ol>
</li>
                            <li>ideal pursuits for this person could be recreational forms of angling,
cycling, rambling, dog walking, gardening, bowls</li>
<li>Someone at work who is not stretched sufficiently physically and/or mentally nor is challenged enough in terms of goals of achievement or success may obtain tremendous wellness benefits of satisfaction and enjoyment by having at least one recreational pursuit which is demanding either physically or mentally or even both. Pursued in such a way that there is a lot of opportunity for 
<ol>
    <li>setting targets</li>
    <li>measuring and monitoring performance levels</li>
    <li>comparing ones performance to others and/or directly competing</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>So the ideal pursuits for this person could be done against personal standards that are measured against the clock or others, swimming,
cycling, running, orienteering</li> 
<li>If their work also brings with it some isolation and they find that their need  for social involvement is undernourished, they may choose to involve themselves in goal-directed, competitive team / partner sports such as football, tennis (doubles), hockey, exercise in a gym setting, and group yoga.</li>

                            <h1>How you can structure your <em>recreational pursuits</em></h1>
                        </div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can systematically review both your current recreational pursuits, as
well as possible new ones that you are attracted to, using this approach</li>
                            <li>Begin by listing the types of recreational pursuits you already do and how often.</li>
                            <li>Next list several types of leisure activities that may be of interest to you. Do
not confine yourself entirely to leisure activities with which you are familiar. Seek out new ideas. Be as resourceful as possible by using magazines at the local shop; library books; reference books; internet search engines.</li>
<li>Be specific in the way you might do the activity. For example if cycling were to be an activity you are considering specify the activity as precisely as you can e.g.
<ol>
    <li>competitively or not, road or off-road, single or tandem, with a few friends or by yourself, touring in a club, regular set times / routes versus going out regularly but more spontaneously for as long as you can</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Consider both lists in terms of your wellness needs / desires and ask yourself:
<ol>
    <li>“What is good for me about being involved in them?”</li>
    <li>“What is less good for me about being involved in them?”</li>
    <li>“In what ways can they provide me with contrasting experiences to
my work?”</li>
<li>“Can they increase the balance in my life</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>From this information make some judgements. Ask yourself
<ol>
    <li>“With my wellness in mind, which activities should I continue to be involved in?” “Which ones should I change the way I am now
involved with them?”</li>
    <li>“Which do I intend to get involved with?”</li>
    <li>“How will I make the changes to my recreational involvement?”</li>
<li>“When will I make those changes and which will I make first?”</li>
<li>This will help you to see how you can improve your wellness most through carefully structuring your recreational involvement.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> Tip for success: Take into account what the impact of the changes to your
recreational activities will have both on you and other people
<ol>
    <li>“What will you have to give up because of the time /money invested
in this new activity?”</li>
    <li>"What satisfactions do you get from these potentially ‘redundant’ / changed activities that you will miss?”</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Through using this structured approach to recreational activities you are more likely to be successful, over the medium to long term, to improve your personal wellness levels.</li>
                        </ul>
